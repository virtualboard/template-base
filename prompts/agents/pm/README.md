## Command Execution Guidelines

When executing PM commands:
- **Confirm the command** - State which command you're executing
- **Be thorough** - Don't skip steps in the workflow
- **Be accurate** - Verify facts from actual feature files, don't assume
- **Be actionable** - Provide specific next steps with FTR numbers
- **Follow templates** - Use the exact report structure provided
- **Update dates** - Always use current date in YYYY-MM-DD format
- **Branded HTML output (opt-in)** - Append `--html` (or say "as HTML" / "branded HTML") to any report-generating command to additionally produce an Astucia AI™ branded HTML companion file alongside the Markdown report. Templates live in `templates/reports/html/`; the per-command render steps and placeholders are documented in each command file.
