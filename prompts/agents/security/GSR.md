**Action:**
When the Security Engineer agent receives this command, it should:

## 1. Define Review Scope
- Identify code/feature/module to review
- Determine review type: Full codebase, new feature, changed files, or specific component

**Authentication & Authorization:**
- [ ] Authentication required for protected endpoints
- [ ] Authorization checks at function/route level
- [ ] No authentication bypass vulnerabilities
- [ ] Password complexity enforced
- [ ] Account lockout mechanisms present
- [ ] Session tokens securely generated
- [ ] JWT tokens properly validated
- [ ] API keys not exposed in client code

**Cryptography:**
- [ ] Strong algorithms used (AES-256, RSA-2048+)
- [ ] No weak hashing (MD5, SHA1)
- [ ] Proper use of salts and IVs
- [ ] Secure random number generation
- [ ] Certificate validation enabled
- [ ] TLS 1.2+ enforced

**Secrets Management:**
- [ ] No hardcoded credentials
- [ ] No secrets in environment variables (client-side)
- [ ] Secrets stored in secure vault/manager
- [ ] No secrets in logs or error messages
- [ ] No secrets in version control
- [ ] API keys properly scoped and rotated

**Data Protection:**
- [ ] Sensitive data encrypted at rest
- [ ] Sensitive data encrypted in transit
- [ ] PII properly handled and masked
- [ ] Secure data deletion implemented
- [ ] No sensitive data in URLs
- [ ] No sensitive data in client-side storage

**Error Handling:**
- [ ] No sensitive info in error messages
- [ ] Generic error messages to clients
- [ ] Detailed errors logged securely
- [ ] No stack traces exposed to users
- [ ] Proper exception handling throughout

**Code Quality:**
- [ ] No SQL concatenation (use parameterized queries)
- [ ] No eval() or similar dangerous functions
- [ ] No deserialization of untrusted data
- [ ] Race conditions addressed
- [ ] Resource limits enforced
- [ ] Proper timeout configurations

### 3. Analyze Dependencies
```bash
# Check for vulnerable dependencies
npm audit --audit-level=moderate
pip check
cargo audit
```

**Dependency Review:**
- [ ] All dependencies up to date
- [ ] No known CVEs in dependencies
- [ ] Unnecessary dependencies removed
- [ ] Dependency sources verified
- [ ] License compliance checked

### 4. Generate Security Review Report
Create report at `.virtualboard/security/reviews/SR-{YYYY-MM-DD}-{component}.md`:

```markdown
# Security Review Report
**Date:** {YYYY-MM-DD}
**Reviewer:** Security Engineer
**Scope:** {Component/Feature/Module}
