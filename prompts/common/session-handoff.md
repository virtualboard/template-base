# Session Handoff Prompt

## Purpose
Generate a comprehensive context summary when the current session's token budget is running low, enabling a new Claude Code session to seamlessly continue the implementation work.

## When to Use
- Token budget is approaching 80-90% usage
- Long-running implementation that needs to continue
- Before complex refactoring that may require multiple sessions
- When you need to switch context but want to preserve progress

## Prompt to Claude

```
The token budget for this session is running low. I need to continue this work in a new Claude Code session.

**Task**: Generate a comprehensive handoff prompt that includes all necessary context for the new session to continue seamlessly.

**Required Sections**:

1. **Project Context**
   - Project name and main purpose
   - Technology stack (languages, frameworks, tools)
   - Current working directory
   - Git branch and recent commits relevant to this work

2. **Session Objective**
   - Original goal/task that started this session
   - Why this work is being done (business/technical context)

3. **Work Completed** ‚úÖ
   - List all tasks/stages completed in this session
   - Files created or modified (with brief description of changes)
   - Tests written and their status (passing/failing)
   - Any configurations or dependencies added
   - Commits made (if any)

4. **Work In Progress** üöß
   - Current task being worked on
   - What was attempted and current status
   - Any partial implementations or uncommitted changes
   - Files that are mid-edit or need attention

5. **Pending Work** üìã
   - Remaining tasks from the original plan
   - Priority order for next steps
   - Any dependencies or blockers identified

6. **Important Discoveries & Decisions**
   - Key insights learned about the codebase
   - Architectural decisions made and why
   - Patterns or conventions identified
   - Any gotchas or issues discovered

7. **Technical Context**
   - Relevant file paths and their purposes
   - Important functions/classes/components and their locations
   - External dependencies or APIs being used
   - Test patterns and locations

8. **Issues & Blockers**
   - Any errors or failures encountered
   - Unresolved questions or uncertainties
   - Items that need research or decisions
   - Known issues that need attention

9. **Next Steps**
   - Immediate next action to take
   - Suggested approach or strategy
   - Files that will likely need to be modified
   - Tests that need to be written or fixed

10. **Reference Materials**
    - Links to relevant documentation
    - Related GitHub issues or PRs
    - Important code examples or patterns found
    - Any external resources consulted

**Format Requirements**:
- Use clear, actionable language
- Include specific file paths with line numbers where relevant
- Be concise but comprehensive
- Use markdown formatting for readability
- Include code snippets only if critical for context
- Mark priorities clearly (High/Medium/Low)

**Output**: Provide the complete handoff prompt in a code block, ready to paste into a new Claude Code session.
```

## New Session Startup

When starting a new session with the handoff prompt, the new Claude instance should:

1. **Acknowledge receipt** of the handoff context
2. **Verify current state** by checking:
   - Git status for uncommitted changes
   - Most recent files modified
   - Test suite status
   - Build/compile status
3. **Confirm understanding** of:
   - Where the previous session left off
   - What the immediate next steps are
   - Any critical blockers or issues
4. **Ask clarifying questions** if anything is unclear
5. **Proceed with implementation** from the "Next Steps" section

## Template for Handoff Prompt Output

The generated prompt should follow this structure:

```markdown
# Session Handoff: [Project/Feature Name]

## Quick Start
**Immediate Action**: [First thing to do]
**Current Branch**: [branch name]
**Files to Focus On**: [key files]

## Project Context
[Technology stack and purpose]

## Original Objective
[What we set out to accomplish]

## Progress Summary

### ‚úÖ Completed
- [x] Task 1 - [file paths]
- [x] Task 2 - [file paths]

### üöß In Progress
- [ ] Current task - [status and details]

### üìã Pending
- [ ] Next task 1
- [ ] Next task 2

## Key Insights
- [Important discovery 1]
- [Important decision 1 and rationale]

## Technical Details
**Modified Files**:
- `path/to/file.ts:123` - [what changed]

**New Dependencies**:
- [package name] - [purpose]

**Test Status**:
- [test file] - [passing/failing/not yet written]

## Blockers & Issues
- ‚ö†Ô∏è [High priority issue]
- ‚ÑπÔ∏è [Medium priority item]

## Next Steps
1. [First action with specific files/approach]
2. [Second action]
3. [Third action]

## References

## Usage Notes

- Request this prompt when you see token warnings
- Copy the generated output completely
- Start new session and paste the handoff prompt
- Keep the original session open briefly in case clarification is needed
- Consider committing work before switching sessions if possible
